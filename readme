# SHL – Generative AI Assessment Recommendation System

This project is a **semantic assessment recommendation system** designed to help recruiters and hiring teams identify the most relevant SHL assessments based on a given job description or hiring requirement.

Instead of relying on keyword matching, the system understands the **context and intent** of the query and recommends suitable assessments using **natural language embeddings** and similarity search.

---

##  What This Project Does

- Accepts a **job description / hiring query** as input  
- Understands intent using **sentence embeddings**
- Matches the query against SHL assessment descriptions
- Returns the **most relevant assessments** with similarity scores  

The system is built as an **end-to-end GenAI application** covering data processing, model inference, evaluation, and a browser-based interface.

---

##  Core Approach

### 1️⃣ Semantic Representation  
Assessment descriptions and user queries are converted into dense vector embeddings using a **sentence-transformer model**.

### 2️⃣ Similarity Search  
Cosine similarity is used to retrieve the closest matching assessments from the vector space using a **Nearest Neighbors** index.

### 3️⃣ Intelligent Re-Ranking  
Results are refined using lightweight **text-based boosting** to improve relevance for domain-specific skills.

##  Dataset

- SHL assessment metadata extracted from product catalog pages  
- Cleaned and structured into:
  - Assessment name  
  - Skills tags  
  - Test type  
  - Canonical description  
  - Assessment URL  

---

##  Evaluation

The system is evaluated using the **provided labeled training queries**.

- **Metric:** Recall@10  
- The evaluation confirms that the correct assessment appears within the top-10 recommendations for most queries.

---

##  User Interface

A simple web interface allows users to:
- Enter a hiring query or job description  
- Select the number of recommendations  
- View ranked assessments with:
  - Assessment name  
  - Test type  
  - Skills covered  
  - Similarity score  

This makes the system easy to test and interpret.

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **Sentence-Transformers**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**

##  Key Highlights

- Context-aware recommendations (not keyword-based)
- Clean separation of data processing, model logic, and UI
- Robust error handling and score normalization
- Easy to extend with new assessments or models

##  Use Case

This system can be used by:
- Recruiters  
- Talent acquisition teams  
- HR platforms  
- Assessment vendors  

to quickly shortlist the **right assessments** for a given role.
