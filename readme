# SHL – Generative AI Assessment Recommendation System

This project implements an offline, end-to-end Assessment Recommendation System
to map recruiter job descriptions to relevant SHL assessments using semantic similarity.

The focus of this assignment is on data processing, embedding-based retrieval,
evaluation, and reproducibility rather than live deployment.

##  Key Features

- Data ingestion from SHL product URLs provided in the dataset
- Web scraping using Playwright
- Text embedding using Sentence Transformers
- Nearest Neighbor based semantic retrieval
- Evaluation using Recall@10
- Final CSV generation for unseen test queries

##  Technical Approach

- **Embedding Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Similarity Search:** scikit-learn NearestNeighbors (cosine similarity)
- **Backend Logic:** Python scripts
- **Output:** CSV-based recommendations
